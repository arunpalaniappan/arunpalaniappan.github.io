		<h1><center> Challenges in Providing Food Security</center></h1>
		<p> Food Corporation of India (FCI) is one of the largest supply chain management systems in Asia. The vision of FCI is to provide a stable food security system to ensure availability, accessibility and affordability of food grains to all people at all time so that no one, nowhere and at no time goes hungry. Food Corporation of India issues food grains to the Public Distribution System (PDS) and other various welfare schemes and programs run by the state and central government like the mid-day meal scheme, wheat based nutritional programs, SABLA etc. FCI procures food grains from farmers at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and issues food grains to the welfare programs and schemes run by the state and central government at Central Issue Price (CIP). There is a top line operational loss incurred by FCI when CIP is less than MSP. Apart from this, FCI also incurs additional expenditure during storage and distribution of food grains. The Government of India reimburses the operation cost of FCI as food subsidy. During the financial year 2017-18, FCI incurred a total food subsidy of Rs. 1, 16, 281.69 Crore. </p>
		
		<p> In spite of such massive investments, is the ultimate of FCI to build a hunger free India by 2030 on track? While the FCI is enduring great financial stress, on the other side, its operations are far away from achieving its mandate of hunger free India by 2030. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report shows that India has the largest population of food insecure people in the world. It can be estimated from the SOFI report that 27.8% of India’s population suffered from moderate or severe food insecurity in 2014-16 and the proportion rose to 31.6% in 2017-19. Similarly, in the 2014 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report, India ranked 55 out of 76 participating countries and in 2020, India skipped back to 94 among 117 countries, suffering from a series level of hunger. The neighboring Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan were ranked in 64, 75, and 88th position. Though our performance in food security is poor, the rankings provide a better lag indicator to measure the efficiency of operation carried out and outcome achieved against total government expenditure. </p>
		
		<p> During the period 2014-19, the combined average amount of the total rice and wheat distributed by FCI to the states/UTs under PDS and welfare programs is 6.5 Crore MT per year. Assuming a constant Below Poverty Line (BPL) population of 300 million over the years, this could have benefitted every individual under BPL with 18.06 kg of food grain every month if the schemes were well targeted. The poor ranking in GHI suggests that states and union territories have failed at targeting food insecure population groups and in extension, there is very shallow targeting and benefits to the BPL population. The first low hanging fruit to improve hunger index scores is to better target food insecure population. It is to be noted that Rangarajan Committee estimated India’s BPL population to be 363 million in the year 2014. </p>
		
		<p> It is evident that the states/UTs tend to overestimate the food grain requirement in their allotment proposal to FCI and on the other hand, food security has become even more alarming in our country. After a series of economic changes and shocks in the form of demonetization, introduction of goods and service tax and covid-19 crisis, people who are marginally above the below poverty line would have been pushed back into the below poverty line. A vast majority of India’s poor will be facing increased food insecurity, hunger and starvation. BPL can be an accurate predictor of food insecure population but only if it collected every year. It becomes imperative to collect BPL data and monitoring food insecure localities more frequently. This should be done at least once in every five years to start with. </p>
		
		<p> The household consumer expenditure survey by the national sample survey office (NSSO) could help in finding income levels of food insecure population. The NSSO survey data can also be used to exploit geospatial information and find localities in states/UTs that should focus more on food security issues. However, it is the collective responsibility of the state/UT governments, district and local government bodies to collect individual household data to find food insecure population and act on subsequent policy making. Leveraging data in policy making will lead to evidence based policy making which will ultimately help in better governance. </p>
		
		<p> The current implementation of PDS is comparatively simple since the population estimates are assumed to be static. This facilitates operationally simple framework for storage and logistics. With the implementation of One Nation One Ration Card scheme, the underlying assumption is that population can migrate across states for work and livelihood and still be a beneficiary of the PDS system. However, the lack of data on migratory population who are also food insecure will impact states proposal for all food schemes. This might lead the states/UTs to make even higher estimation of required food grains and ultimately ending up getting wasted. This will also strain the food distribution system and further increase the budget of FCI. Developing a robust migration database can help the state and local bodies to understand the patterns of the floating population. This will largely help in precise targeting of welfare schemes and calculate better estimates of food insecure population. The use of smart cards and Aadhar cards at fair-price shops is a great step in that direction. However, there are practical challenges like network connectivity at remote locations which are to be addressed for a smooth functioning of public distribution system.</p>
		
		<p> The final suggestion is the need to establish an independent central auditing body to audit the operations of FCI and improve upon them. The auditing body should audit the whole process cycle from procurement to distribution and provide recommendations to FCI in doing efficient operation. Collecting granular data at each level of the FCI – from the time when the food grain leaves the hands of farmers till it reaches the hands of scheme wise beneficiaries will be helpful to do the auditing process. The recommendation of the auditing body could be used to improve process efficiency in procurement, reduce wastage of food grains in storage, quicker movement of food grains with low wastage in transport and to keep a check on whether food grains are reaching the real food insecure. <p>
		
		
		<p> Achieving the goal of zero hunger is a collective responsibility of the entire nation. We strongly believe that India can steadily progress on achieving zero hunger by 2030, agreed at the United Nations. The future belongs to today’s youth. A greater awareness on the Food Security Act (FSA) and the benefit they entitle will make sure that our food system nourish the vibrant and young population and make a great India. </p>
