This is a short project. I have shared the abstract here. It is in ideating phase and I have set timeline for this project as Nov 2020 - Dec 2020. The outcome will be an essay and if possible, a paper.

Key Ideas:
	1) During COVID-19, people would have suffered from mental health. Capturing the extent to which people suffered from mental health is a difficult task.
	2) Searching for terms related to mental health in google trends like insomnia, sleep, boredom, sadness will help in understanding how people's mental health differed from pre-covid time and during covid time.

More work has to be done for framing a well defined problem statement.
